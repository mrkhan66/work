**Title:** Bike Loan EMI Calculator with Advanced Features

**Description:**  
Create an interactive EMI calculator that allows users to calculate their monthly EMI for a bike loan. The calculator should include the following features:

1. **Bike Details:**
   - Input field for the bike's name.
   - Input field for the bike's MRP (Maximum Retail Price).

2. **Loan Amount:**
   - Input field for the user to enter the desired loan amount.
   - The loan amount should be automatically calculated as a percentage of the bike's MRP (e.g., 80% of MRP) but allow the user to manually adjust it.

3. **Interest Scheme:**
   - Dropdown or input field for the user to select or enter the interest rate (in percentage).
   - Input field for the loan tenure in years (e.g., 1 year, 2 years, 3 years).
   - The interest should be calculated based on the loan amount and tenure, and the total interest should be added to the loan amount.

4. **Down Payment:**
   - Input field for the user to enter the down payment amount (if any).
   - The loan amount should be adjusted accordingly after subtracting the down payment.

5. **EMI Calculation:**
   - Automatically calculate and display the EMI for three standard tenures: 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months.
   - The EMI should be calculated based on the adjusted loan amount (after down payment) and the total interest.

6. **Monthly EMI Breakdown:**
   - Display a detailed breakdown of the EMI for each tenure, showing:
     - Principal amount.
     - Interest amount.
     - Total payment (Principal + Interest).
   - Provide a clear summary of the total amount payable over the loan tenure.

7. **User Interface:**
   - The UI should be clean, intuitive, and user-friendly.
   - Use sliders or dropdowns for easy input adjustment.
   - Display the results in a well-organized manner with clear labels.

**Example Workflow:**

1. User enters the bike name and MRP.
2. User enters the loan amount (default is 80% of MRP, but adjustable).
3. User selects the interest rate and loan tenure.
4. User enters the down payment (optional).
5. The calculator automatically displays the EMI for 12, 24, and 36 months.
6. The user can see the monthly EMI breakdown and total payable amount for each tenure.

**Additional Features:**
- Allow the user to switch between different interest schemes (e.g., fixed interest, reducing balance).
- Provide a graphical representation of the EMI breakdown (e.g., pie chart or bar graph).
- Option to export the EMI details as a PDF or share via email.

**Output Example:**

```

MRP: ₹1,00,000
Loan Amount: ₹80,000
