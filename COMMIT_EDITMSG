Agent query: Please check if the following features are working:
1. Can you edit the MRP after selecting a bike?
2. Can you add a scheme amount that adds to the MRP?
3. Do you see the 2.5 years EMI breakdown?
4. How does the new UI look?

Enhance EMI calculator UI and functionality: Add custom MRP input, scheme amount input, 2.5-year tenure option, improved styling, and refined breakdown display.
